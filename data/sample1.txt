Title: CIFAR-10 experiments

Methods:
The experiment used CIFAR-10 with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
We trained multiple convolutional neural network architectures with data augmentation.
Training used SGD with momentum and learning rate schedules across 100 epochs.

Results:
The top model achieved 92% accuracy on the test set.
Ablation studies show data augmentation improved generalization by 3-5%.

Conclusion:
Careful model selection and augmentation yield strong performance on CIFAR-10.
