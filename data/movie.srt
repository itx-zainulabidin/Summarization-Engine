[mechanical whirring]

20
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,641
Good morning, James.

21
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,934
How are you feeling?

22
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,143
Wait. What?

23
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,355
It's perfectly normal
to feel confused.

24
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,984
You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.

25
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,860
What?

26
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,445
It's okay, James.

27
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,906
-[softly] It's Jim.
-Jim.

28
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,743
Just breathe.
Everything is okay.

29
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,120
Where am I?

30
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,289
You're a passenger
on the Starship Avalon,

31
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,001
the Homestead Company's
premier interstellar starliner.

32
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,797
We've nearly completed
the voyage from Earth
to your new home.

33
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,216
The colony world
of Homestead II.

34
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,012
A new world. A fresh start.

35
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,596
Room to grow.

36
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,390
[whispers] Yeah.

37
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,475
The Avalon
is on final approach.

38
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,644
For the next four months,
you'll enjoy space travel

39
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,646
at its most luxurious.

40
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,607
Food. Fun. Friends.

41
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,152
-My friends.
-That's right, Jim.

42
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,072
The ID band on your wrist
is your key to the wonders
of the Avalon.

43
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,991
[electronic chime]

44
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,993
You're in perfect health, Jim.

45
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,620
Let's get you to your cabin,
where you can get some rest.

46
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,916
[low whirring]

47
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,757
[attendant] You may be
experiencing post-hibernation
sickness.

48
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,053
Your door will illuminate
for you.

49
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,682
Welcome to your cabin,

50
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,893
your home until
we make landfall.

51
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,144
Over the next four months,

52
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:56,105
you'll prepare for your
new life on Homestead II,

53
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,692
meet your fellow passengers,
take skill-building classes,

54
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,652
and learn about
colonial living.

55
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,572
You've been assigned
to learning group 38

56
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,742
for passengers with engineering
and technical trade skills.

57
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,578
Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.

58
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,498
Jim.

59
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,250
Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.

60
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:25,218
To help you recover from
hibernation, be sure to drink
plenty of fluids.

61
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,597
Enjoy the rest of your voyage
on the Avalon,

62
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,849
a Homestead Company Starship.

63
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,937
[Deejay] Good morning,
one and all.

64
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,689
It's a beautiful morning
here on the Starship Avalon.

65
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,442
Whatever you do, don't get
homesick, get Homestead.

66
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,986
Let's start things off
with one of my favorites
back on Earth.

67
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,786
No.

68
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,624
That's stupid.

69
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,464
Just own it. Own it, Jim.
You got a cool jacket.

70
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,633
[mechanical whirring]

71
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,056
[orchestral fanfare playing]

72
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,564
Hello, passengers.

73
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,191
Will you all please
take a seat?

74
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,279
Welcome, learning group 38.

75
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,073
Your introduction
to colonial life.

76
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,494
Earth is a prosperous planet,
the cradle of civilization.

77
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:38,833
But for many, it's also
overpopulated,
overpriced, overrated.

78
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,502
I'm sorry, I think
I may be in the wrong...

79
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,421
Hold all questions
till the end, please.

80
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,464
Sorry.

81
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,425
The colonies offer
an alternative,
a better way of life.

82
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,676
Where are all the other...

83
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,805
And there's no colony
more beautiful
than Homestead II,

84
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,807
the jewel
of the occupied world.

85
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,100
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

86
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,602
Where is everybody?

87
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,062
We are all
on the Starship Avalon.

88
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,522
But I'm the only one here.

89
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,860
There are 5,000 passengers
and 258 crew members.

90
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,487
So why am I alone?

91
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,822
We're all in this together.

92
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,117
Hello?

93
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,412
Anybody here?

94
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,914
Hello?

95
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,136
[Avalon] Please buckle up
and secure any loose items.

96
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,973
This elevator will experience
a momentary lapse in gravity.

97
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,436
[gasping softly]

98
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,865
[rumbling]

99
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,706
[Avalon] Grand concourse.

100
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,295
[whirring]

101
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,471
[Infomat] Hello.

102
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,057
Welcome to the grand concourse
aboard the Avalon.

103
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,308
Can I help you?

104
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,936
I need to talk to a person.

105
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,854
A real live person, please?

106
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,107
What sort of person?
Personal trainer?
Travel planner?

107
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,858
-Therapist?
-I don't know.

108
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,277
Somebody in charge.

109
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,195
The ship's steward
handles passenger affairs.

110
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,364
It's on level three
of the grand concourse.

111
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,116
-Thank you.
-Happy to help.

112
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,998
Not good.

113
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,791
-[Infomat] Hello.
-Who's flying the ship?

114
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,835
The flight crew, the captain,
the pilot,
the chief navigator...

115
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,004
Captain. I want to speak
to the captain.

116
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,880
The captain rarely handles
passenger queries...

117
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,757
It's an emergency! Please.

118
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,469
The captain is usually found
on the bridge,
in the command ring.

119
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,769
[beeping]

120
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,941
[Avalon] Bridge access requires
special authorization.

121
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,904
Bridge access requires
special authorization.

122
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,826
You got to be kidding me.

123
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,953
[panting]

124
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,419
[orchestral fanfare playing]

125
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,759
[observatory] Welcome
to the observatory.

126
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,471
What can I show you?

127
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,390
We're supposed to land soon.

128
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,017
[chuckles]

129
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,063
I... I'm the only one awake.

130
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,107
I don't understand.
What can I show you?

131
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,693
Show me Homestead II.

132
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,030
Homestead II is the fourth
planet in the Bhakti System.

133
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,366
Right. And where are we?

134
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,452
We're in transit
from Earth to Homestead II.

135
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,372
We will arrive in approximately
90 years.

136
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,456
What?

137
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,876
We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, three weeks,
and one day.

138
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,169
No. Wait.

139
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,879
How long ago
did we leave Earth?

140
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,548
Approximately 30 years ago.

141
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,221
I woke up too soon.

142
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,100
[Infomat] Hello.

143
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,726
How do I send a message
to Earth?

144
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,229
Interstellar messages
are sent by laser array.

145
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,772
This is an expensive service.

146
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,732
-Bite me.
-Happy to help.

147
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,820
[Avalon] Planet and connection?

148
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,863
Earth. The Homestead Company.

149
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:42,576
There are 30,826 contacts
listed under Homestead Company.

150
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,996
I'm emigrating to Homestead II
and I have an emergency.

151
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,248
I have a customer help line.

152
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,416
Sounds about right.

153
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,917
Begin message.

154
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,754
Hi. I'm Jim Preston.

155
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm a passenger on the Avalon.

156
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,050
I...

157
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,181
I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

158
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,641
I woke up too soon.

159
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:09,395
And I mean, way too soon.

160
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,022
Nobody else is awake, and...

161
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,275
I don't know how to get
back to sleep.

162
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,611
And the thing is,
there's 90 years to go.

163
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,242
At this rate, I'm...

164
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,540
I'm sorry,
I'm trying to fix this.

165
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,084
Maybe I missed something.
I could use a hand.

166
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,545
That's all.

167
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,630
Thank you.

168
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,300
Message sent.

169
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,553
Outstanding.

170
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,014
Message will arrive
in 19 years.

171
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,140
Wait, what?

172
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,726
Earliest reply in 55 years.

173
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,561
Fifty-five years?

174
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,230
We apologize for the delay.

175
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,941
That will be $ 6,012.

176
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,991
[jazz music playing]

177
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,707
-Afternoon.
-Man!

178
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,834
Is it good to see another face!

179
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,794
Thought I was
the only one awake.

180
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,006
Who wants to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

181
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,051
No, I mean we're in trouble.
We're not supposed to be here.

182
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,969
Well, I won't tell
if you don't.

183
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,346
Huh?

184
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,805
Our little secret.

185
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,850
What can I get for you?

186
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,227
What?

187
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,728
You look like a whiskey man.

188
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,522
Okay.

189
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,819
You're a robot.

190
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,114
Android. Technically.

191
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,618
Arthur's the name.

192
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,746
-Jim.
-Pleased to meet you, Jim.

193
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,796
How much do you know
about this ship?

194
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,631
I don't know.

195
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,966
I know some things.

196
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,260
What do I do
if my hibernation pod
malfunctions?

197
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,887
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

198
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,222
They never malfunction.

199
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,557
Well, I woke up early.

200
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,141
Can't happen.

201
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,602
How long until we get
to Homestead II?

202
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,479
About 90 years or so.

203
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,648
And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

204
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,567
Not till the last four months.

205
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,486
How is it that I'm sitting
here with you

206
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,947
with 90 years to go?

207
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,911
It's not possible for you
to be here.

208
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,165
Well, I am.

209
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,798
[Deejay] Good morning.
It's a beautiful day here
on the Avalon.

210
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,093
So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax
and enjoy your stay.

211
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,763
[electronic pulsing]

212
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,520
[electronic chime]

213
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,981
[Avalon] Please
make a selection.

214
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,862
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino
Extreme is reserved for
gold-class passengers.

215
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,531
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino
Extreme is reserved for...

216
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,033
I want
the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme.

217
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,159
Bill my room, please.

218
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,744
Food can be purchased
in the ship's...

219
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,370
Sorry. The French Roast...

220
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,788
Sorry. The Pumpkin Spice...

221
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,457
Sorry. Vanilla Chai...

222
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,791
Sorry. Sorry.

223
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,959
Sorry.

224
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,045
Large coffee.

225
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,047
-Cream...
-Please enjoy your coffee.

226
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,632
Really?

227
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,819
[whooshing]

228
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,960
[electricity crackling]

229
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,176
[pod whirring]

230
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,407
[strained grunting]

231
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,955
[gasps]

232
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,550
[Avalon] Crew pod room access
requires special authorization.

233
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,302
[tool whirring]

234
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,055
[grunting]

235
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,853
[thudding]

236
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,803
[Avalon] Grand...

237
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,013
Going...

238
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,015
Please make... Level...

239
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,268
Grand concourse.

240
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,603
I'm screwed, Arthur.

241
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,147
Completely
and ridiculously screwed.

242
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,565
Come on, now.

243
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,859
Every cloud has
a silver lining.

244
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,697
Guess I am gonna die
of old age on this ship.

245
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,157
We all die.

246
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,785
Even androids end up
on the scrap heap.

247
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,497
I'm your only customer.
Why are you always
polishing a glass?

248
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,957
Trick of the trade.

249
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,710
Makes people nervous
when a bartender just
stands there.

250
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,378
So lay some bartender
wisdom on me.

251
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,214
I'm lost in space here.

252
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,593
You're not where you
want to be.

253
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,805
You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

254
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,723
[snorts]

255
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,143
You said it.

256
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,937
Well, say you could
snap your fingers

257
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,397
and be wherever
you wanted to be.

258
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,316
I bet you'd still feel
this way.

259
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,859
Not in the right place.

260
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,238
Point is, you can't get so
hung up on where
you'd rather be

261
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,324
that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

262
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,284
What are you telling me?

263
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,621
Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

264
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,707
Live a little.

265
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,793
Live a little.

266
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,505
[grunts]

267
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,215
[electricity whirring]

268
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,847
[Avalon] Welcome
to the Vienna Suite.

269
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,558
Yeah.

270
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,853
[chuckles]

271
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,647
What?

272
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
[pop music playing]

273
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,448
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah!

274
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,033
Make that a double
jumbo shrimp.

275
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,326
Triple.

276
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,578
[speaking Japanese]

277
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,872
Dance-off.

278
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,542
All right.

279
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,879
I did exactly
what you just did.

280
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,094
[Avalon] Large coffee.

281
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,350
[Jim speaking Spanish]

282
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,144
[waiter] You have
had many, señor.

283
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,645
[continues speaking Spanish]

284
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,609
Gracias.

285
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,238
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

286
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,581
Get out of here!

287
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,417
Come back. Hey.

288
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,171
Come here.

289
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,287
[yells]

290
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,270
[Avalon] Welcome, Jim.

291
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,231
Please turn your attention

292
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,150
to the screens displaying
safety tips.

293
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,111
These spacesuits are designed

294
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,738
to withstand
the harsh environment of space.

295
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,324
The carbon fiber
and polyamide construction

296
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,828
means your suit
is both flexible and durable.

297
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,218
Remember, your spacesuit
is your lifeline.

298
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,845
[beeps]

299
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,897
Slide the handle on the right
to release the air pressure.

300
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,443
Your magnetic boots
are now engaged.

301
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,653
They can be deactivated
using the control panel
on your arm.

302
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,490
Press the red button
to open the airlock door.

303
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,163
Have a wonderful time.

304
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,796
Tether attached.

305
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,761
[Avalon] Welcome back, Jim.

306
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,559
We hope you decide
to join us again soon

307
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,978
for another
thrilling experience.

308
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,837
Have a wonderful time.

309
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,851
[breathes deeply]

310
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,355
[panting]

311
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,779
[groans]

312
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,163
[sobbing quietly]

313
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,675
[exhales]

314
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,877
Aurora.

315
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,923
[Avalon] Searching
passenger profiles.

316
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,925
I'm Aurora Lane.

317
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,970
Passenger 1456. I'm a writer.

318
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,763
I think we tell
each other stories

319
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,641
to know we're not alone,
to make contact.

320
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,144
[man] Your father
was Oliver Lane, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning author.

321
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,521
No pressure, right?

322
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,941
My dad used to say,
"If you live an ordinary life,

323
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,360
all you'll have
are ordinary stories.

324
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,404
You have to live
a life of adventure."

325
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,115
So...

326
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,033
Here I am.

327
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,250
Good morning.

328
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,797
We're starting over
in every way.

329
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,092
I'll have to figure out
where to live, how to live,

330
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,510
who my friends will be.

331
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,053
It's like the first day
of school.

332
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,472
If the school bus
took 120 years to get there.

333
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,598
[chuckles]

334
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,227
We're creating a culture...

335
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,562
You are funny.

336
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,440
Do you ever read something
and feel like it's written
just for you?

337
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,900
I don't do a lot of reading.

338
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,444
She's good.

339
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,779
Who's that?

340
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,281
Aurora.

341
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,284
The sleeping girl.

342
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,249
You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil,

343
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,293
but it sure has a nasty
sense of humor.

344
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,461
How is that?

345
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,796
You get to fly
to another planet,

346
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,757
but you'll die along the way.

347
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,761
And you find the perfect woman

348
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,555
right in front of you...

349
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,017
Yet she's completely
out of reach.

350
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,314
Yeah, I'll miss New York City.

351
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,941
Give me a cup of coffee
and a view
of the Chrysler Building,

352
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,234
and I can write all day.

353
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,779
They do have coffee
on Homestead II, right?

354
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:36,863
They better have coffee.

355
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,366
If they don't, I have to turn
around and come back to Earth.

356
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,577
[man] Is there anything
you regret leaving behind?

357
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,374
Yeah, I'll miss the trees
in Central Park
turning in the fall.

358
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,210
I'll also miss crowds...

359
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,679
Say you were trapped
on a desert island,

360
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,974
and you had the power
to wish somebody
there with you.

361
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,893
You wouldn't be alone anymore.

362
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,979
But you'd be stranding
the person on the island.

363
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,482
How do you...
Would you make that wish?

364
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,068
I don't know.
I've never been on an island.

365
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,361
Okay, well, yeah.

366
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,197
Forget the island.

367
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,327
Let's say you figured out
how to do something

368
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,496
that would make your life
a million times better,

369
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,374
but you knew it was wrong
and there's no taking it back.

370
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,542
How do you do the math?

371
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,794
Jim, these
are not robot questions.

372
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,421
[exhales]

373
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,844
I know how to wake Aurora up.

374
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,555
Well, that seems like
a fine idea.

375
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,931
You could use some company.

376
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,642
I'd be stranding her
on this ship
for the rest of her life.

377
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,811
Well, you can't do that.

378
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,605
What am I gonna do?

379
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,023
I'm here for you.

380
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,942
Arthur, you're a machine.

381
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,408
See? You can't feel that.
You don't have feelings.

382
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,412
See?

383
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,955
That doesn't hurt.

384
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,790
And you don't even mind.

385
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,419
'Cause you're not a person.

386
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,550
[grunting]

387
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,510
Don't even think about it.

388
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,012
No more Aurora talk.

389
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,555
I'm over it.

390
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,015
I'm moving on.

391
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,143
Don't even think about it!

392
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,103
What am I gonna do?
I'm just gonna sit
and think about it?

393
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,730
I can't think about it,
so I'm not going to.

394
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,857
That's the deal.
I've made my decision.

395
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,941
I know what I'm doing.

396
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,568
I just cut it off.

397
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,238
I'm not... No more.

398
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,740
You won't hear me
bring up her name again.

399
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,116
I'll never even mention
her name again.

400
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:46,993
Done.

401
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,206
You can't do it.

402
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,754
Shaving off my beard.

403
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,676
[sighs]

404
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,517
Please don't do it.

405
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,389
[electricity crackling]

406
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,476
[mechanical whirring]

407
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,464
Good morning, Aurora.

408
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,466
How are you feeling?

409
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,469
It's perfectly normal
to feel confused.

410
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,805
You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.

411
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,990
[panting]

412
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,272
[Avalon] Grand concourse.

413
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,816
[Aurora] Hello?

414
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,529
Anybody?

415
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,831
Hello.

416
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,502
Hi.

417
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,215
Are you passenger or crew?

418
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,760
Passenger.

419
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,595
Jim Preston.

420
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,055
Aurora Lane.

421
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,559
Do you know what's going on?

422
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,602
Nobody else from my row
woke up.

423
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:43,938
Same for me.

424
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,691
The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do,

425
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,027
but I haven't seen anybody.

426
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,948
The crew is still asleep.

427
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,869
Are you saying nobody's awake?

428
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,620
Just me.

429
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,080
Just you?

430
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,498
It's just us.

431
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,918
But somebody's got to land
the ship in a few weeks.

432
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,922
[observatory] We will arrive
in approximately 89 years.

433
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,258
Eighty-nine years?

434
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,305
The other passengers
aren't late waking up.

435
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,308
We were early.

436
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,356
We need help.

437
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,900
Where's the crew?

438
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,028
[Jim] The crew's in a secure
hibernation room.

439
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,782
Everything important,
the controls,
the reactors, the engines...

440
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,075
It's all behind firewalls.

441
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,785
There's no way through.

442
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,380
How long have you been awake?

443
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,092
A year and three weeks.

444
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,386
No. No, no, no.

445
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,806
No, this can't be happening.

446
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,308
We have to go back to sleep.

447
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,268
Aurora, we can't.

448
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,399
We just have to get back
to our pods
and start them up again.

449
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,362
I can't find my pod.
I can't find my pod.

450
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,697
I can't find my pod.
I don't know which...

451
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,199
It doesn't matter.

452
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,910
-Aurora...
-I can't find it!

453
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,662
-Stop. Aurora...
-I can't find which
one is mine!

454
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,413
-Stop.
-I don't know which
one is mine!

455
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,581
-I'll help you.
-I can't...

456
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,167
Stop! It doesn't matter.

457
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,173
[Jim] Putting somebody into
hibernation requires
special equipment.

458
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,717
Remember the facility
where they put us under,

459
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,178
all the procedures
we went through?

460
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,472
These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

461
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,099
to wake us up
at the right time,

462
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,851
but they can't put
us back to sleep.

463
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,812
You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation?

464
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,356
No.

465
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,316
But there has to be.

466
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,569
There has to be.

467
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,205
Nine o'clock. Nighttime.

468
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,457
[soft electronic chiming]

469
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,172
I know I should be
working the problem, but...

470
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,591
I can't even keep my eyes open.

471
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,635
You just came
out of hibernation.

472
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,054
It's going to be a couple
of days before you're 100%.

473
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,556
You should get some rest.

474
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,309
Think I'm gonna have to.

475
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,020
I'll walk you to your cabin.

476
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,647
No, it's okay.
I'll be all right.

477
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,150
Okay.

478
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,360
[electronic bell dings]

479
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,613
Good night, Aurora.

480
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:40,907
[sighs]

481
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,325
More than a year?

482
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,951
I can't imagine.

483
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,537
It must have been
so hard for you.

484
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,623
It was.

485
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,249
Good night, Jim.

486
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,421
[Avalon] Please buckle up
and secure any loose items.

487
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,968
-Whiskey, neat.
-Sure thing.

488
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,637
[whirring]

489
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,267
How's your day been?

490
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,145
Aurora's awake.

491
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,064
Congratulations.

492
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,651
You don't look happy.

493
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,698
Arthur, can you keep a secret?

494
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,033
Jim...

495
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,953
I'm not just a bartender,
I'm a gentleman.

496
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,830
Don't tell Aurora
that I woke her up.

497
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,669
She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

498
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,295
Of course.

499
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,008
[gasping]

500
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,186
How can there be no way
to put someone back
into hibernation?

501
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,688
What if a pod breaks down?

502
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,858
[Infomat] No hibernation pod
has malfunctioned in thousands
of interstellar flights.

503
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,070
Well, I'm awake.

504
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,489
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

505
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,324
Good morning.

506
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,994
-Have you eaten?
-No. I'm starving.

507
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,538
And this
is the dumbest machine.

508
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,123
Happy to help.

509
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,096
[Avalon] Gold-class breakfast.

510
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,233
Well, you're a man
of simple tastes.

511
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,944
I'm not a gold-class passenger.

512
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,449
French breakfast puff's
above my pay grade.

513
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,992
What? This whole time?

514
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,994
-Yeah.
-What can I get you?

515
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,912
-No. No, I'm fine.
-Stop it.

516
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,748
Really. Okay.

517
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,834
Here you go.

518
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,213
[laughs quietly]

519
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,007
Yeah.

520
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,677
So, I was thinking,
maybe there's another
way to go to sleep.

521
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,970
What about the infirmary?

522
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,306
I checked it out.
It's just scanners
and an Autodoc.

523
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,808
There could be another
hibernation machine
in the cargo hold.

524
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,101
I had that thought, too.

525
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,436
And then I read the manifest.

526
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,605
It's mostly farming stuff,
machines, and trade goods.

527
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,191
Replacement parts
for computers and engineering.

528
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,651
We're not gonna find
a hibernation facility
in a box.

529
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,487
-We could build our own.
-We can't.

530
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,654
Jim, you're not even trying.

531
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,032
I have tried everything.

532
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,909
For over a year, I...

533
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,620
I tried everything.

534
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,996
Well...

535
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,333
Well, I'm not ready to give up.

536
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,260
[Avalon] Infirmary.

537
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,854
What about research articles?
Any kind of technical
documents.

538
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,524
[Avalon] Hibernation technology
is proprietary.

539
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:05,319
The following articles deal
with the subject on
a theoretical level.

540
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,696
[grunting]

541
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,761
[whirring and thumping]

542
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,906
New file. My voyage.

543
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,744
I boarded the Avalon
with an idea,
a destination.

544
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,915
Both now out of reach.

545
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,128
I've been awake for seven days.

546
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,006
Awake far too soon.

547
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,758
And I may well spend
the rest of my life here,

548
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:14,180
in a steel world
1,000 meters long.

549
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:20,019
There's another passenger
awake, a mechanic
named Jim Preston.

550
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,690
He seems to have accepted
our fate.

551
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,568
But I'm scared.

552
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,029
I'm fighting to stay calm.

553
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,284
All the other passengers
will sleep

554
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,578
for another 90 years,

555
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,123
while I live out my life
on this ship,

556
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,709
traveling forever...

557
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,670
Never arriving...

558
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,882
My only companion
a total stranger.

559
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,267
Why did you do it?

560
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,063
Do what?

561
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,025
Emigrate. Leave Earth.

562
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,611
I'm interviewing you.

563
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:11,987
You're what?

564
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,324
You were the first hibernation
failure in the history
of space travel.

565
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,659
That makes you a story.

566
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,869
Who you gonna tell?

567
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,120
Posterity.

568
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,082
So, why did you
give up your life on Earth?

569
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,501
A 120-year space hibernation

570
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,670
means you'll never see
your family or friends again.

571
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,215
You'll wake up in a new century
on a new planet.

572
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,926
It's the ultimate
geographical suicide.

573
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,428
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

574
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,138
But it's my interview.

575
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,391
Were you running away
from something?

576
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,642
No.

577
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,353
-Everything was okay.
-So?

578
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,313
Well, I guess I just wanted
a new world,

579
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,606
I don't know, a fresh start.

580
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,608
That's Homestead
Company advertising.

581
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,110
-Is it?
-Jim.

582
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,153
I know. I guess. You're right.

583
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,537
Back on Earth, when something
breaks, you don't fix it,
you replace it.

584
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,707
The colonies,
they have problems to solve.

585
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,792
They're my kind of problems.

586
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,296
And a mechanic is somebody.

587
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,965
This is a new world
still being built.

588
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,052
I could build a house
and live in it.

589
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,935
Open country. Room to grow.

590
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,520
Now you're back to slogans.

591
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,355
Can't slogans be true?

592
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,567
Do you know how much
Homestead Company

593
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,736
made off its first planet?

594
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,863
Eight quadrillion dollars.

595
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,657
That's eight million billions.

596
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,160
Colony planets
are the biggest business going.

597
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,245
Did you pay full price
for your ticket?

598
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,706
No. I'm in a desirable trade.

599
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:50,377
So they fill your head
with dreams,
discount your ticket,

600
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,296
and you fly off
to populate their planet,

601
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,465
and give Homestead
20% of everything that you make

602
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,591
for the rest of your life.

603
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,594
Not to mention the debt
you run up
on this fancy starship.

604
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,180
So all you see here
is 5,000 suckers?

605
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,434
I see zeros
on the Homestead Company's
bottom line.

606
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,854
I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

607
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,399
For 5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

608
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,194
I'm a journalist.
I know people.

609
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,113
Really?

610
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,782
This one.

611
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,660
Is he a banker, a teacher,
or a gardener?

612
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,080
-Banker.
-He's a gardener.

613
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,209
And her. Is she a...

614
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,045
Madison, Donna, or a Lola?

615
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,382
Donna's too serious
for that hair.

616
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,633
Lola.

617
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,511
-Madison.
-Shit!

618
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,766
All right, chef, accountant,
or midwife?

619
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,850
She has to be a midwife.

620
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,477
There's no way you just made
that one up.

621
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,603
Yeah. She's a midwife.

622
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,148
I didn't know they still
had midwives.

623
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,112
I like her. We'd be friends.

624
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,114
You think you can see that?

625
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,657
Don't you?

626
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,285
I do.

627
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,996
-A round-trip ticket?
-That's right.

628
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,457
I was gonna fly
to Homestead II,
live for a year,

629
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,875
and then right back to Earth.

630
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,877
I don't get it. I left Earth
for a new life,

631
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,504
but you end up back
where you started?

632
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,964
I end up in the future.

633
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,508
Two hundred and fifty years
in the future,

634
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,344
on Earth, which is still
the center of civilization,

635
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,679
like it or not.

636
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:28,016
And I'll be the only writer
to ever travel to
a colony world and come back.

637
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,018
I'll have a story no one
else can tell.

638
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,145
What story?

639
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,022
Humanity's flight to the stars.

640
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,024
The greatest migration
in human history.

641
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,776
It's the biggest story
there is.

642
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,028
But you won't know
any of the people who
are reading it.

643
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,196
But they'd be reading it.

644
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,200
Or they would have been.

645
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,370
I'll never write it now.

646
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,581
I don't know if I'll ever
write again.

647
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,003
Jim, I can't think of anything
else to try

648
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,464
to save us.

649
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,759
And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

650
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,763
What is there to do
around here?

651
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,641
[electronic music chiming]

652
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,977

-Dead serious.

-Partner mode.

[upbeat dance music playing]

656
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,532
You just stand here.

657
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,242
And then we repeat
what they do.

658
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,711
Is there anything else
we can do?

659
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:38,837
-Just do the...
-Okay.

660
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,005
-You don't have to.
-Okay. I can...

-[video game] Beat down!
-Hey!

662
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,510
Here we go. Let's see it.

Whoa! Whoa!

-Why you smiling?
-Aurora! Aurora!

'Cause I'm up two points.

Who's the lovely lady?

667
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,978
This is Aurora.

668
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,231
Aurora. A pleasure.

-I can't!
-You did great!

671
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,570
Okay, one more time.
One more time, let's see it.

672
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:16,833
Yes!

673
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,919
[chuckles]

674
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,964
I swear, I didn't wear pants
for a month.

675
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,633
Seven weeks and two days,
to be exact.

676

The man has no shame.

677
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,720
Well, you're a little lacking
in that area yourself, Arthur.

678
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,472
[Jim and Aurora laugh]

679
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,517
I laughed at the man

I have no legs.

I almost forgot my life
is in ruins.

I'm sorry.

683

What for?

684
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,159

Hi.

Here you go.

696
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,271
Is he asking me on a date?

697

Do you need a pen?

698

Wow.

704
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,508
You clean up
pretty good yourself.

705
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,427
You went shopping.

Very nice.

Space.

717
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,633
The one thing
I do not need more of.

718
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,262
[speaking French]

719
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,432
That was so good.

720
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,184
It wasn't easy getting
a reservation.

721
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,853
They're probably gonna want us
to give up our table.

722
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,188
I'm getting
a lot of dirty looks.

723
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,815
Very popular tonight.

724
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,066
[Aurora chuckles]

725
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,318
So how's your book coming?

726
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,487
I don't really know
what it is yet.

727
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,698
My dad, he used to always
write about his life,

728
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,367
but he had stories.

729
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,286
He'd sailed around Antarctica.

730
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,539
He was a war reporter.

731
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,833
He had lovers.

732
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,543
He wrote about his daughter.

733
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,461
He wrote about you?

734
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,297
Yeah. I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

735
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,382
How was that?

736
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,759
Not always easy.

737
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,428
A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

738
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,515
And then, when I was 17,

739
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,017
he had a heart attack.

740
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,020
Right at his keypad.

741
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,273
End of story.

742
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,070
That was so serious. I'm sorry.

743
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:38,822
We need more wine.

744
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,448
I like hearing about your life.

745
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,368
Thanks.

746
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,205
Why are we here?

747
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,415
You'll see.

748
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,085
Best show in town.

749
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,757
So you've done this before?

750
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,342
Yeah.

751
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,886
And it's safe?

752
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,304
No.

753
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,890
Reasonably safe.

754
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,019
Hop in. You're next.

755
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,855
What about my dress?

756
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,734
Right.

757
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,235
[chuckles]

758
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,946
Turn around.

759
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,479
[Avalon] Tether attached.

760
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,646
What are you doing?

761
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,439
Do you trust me?

762
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,280
Thank you.

763
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,826
[Aurora exhales]

764
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,581
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

765
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,045
You kill me.

766
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,755
You okay?

767
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:07,507
Yeah.

768
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,885
I'm fine.

769
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,846
It's just...

770
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,767
[sighs]

771
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:21,938
Yeah, I know.

772
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,582
[Aurora] So,
I'm seeing someone.

773
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,417
You'll never guess who.

774
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,046
We're the last two people
in the world
who would ever get together.

775
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,382
But here we are.

776
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,884
The last two people
in the world.

777
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,385
What's that?

778
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,887
I'm writing, Arthur. Hush.

779
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:58,266
Jim and I live
in accidental happiness.

780
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:01,269
Like castaways,
making their home
on strange shores.

781
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,521
"Strange shores." I love it.

782
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,898
You do? You don't have
to say that.

783
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,025
-I know.
-You're not gonna eat this.

784
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,070
Does that seem fishy to you?

785
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,324
Keep reading.

786
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,950
It's funny.

787
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,952
We all have dreams.

788
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,207
We plan our futures
like we're the captains
of our fates.

789
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,626
But we're passengers.

790
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,628
We go where fate takes us.

791
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,088
I can't

792
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,256
Help

793
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,299
Arthur!

794
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,884
[Aurora] This isn't the life
we planned.

795
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,802
But it's ours.

796
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,472
And for the first time
in my life,

797
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,432
I don't feel alone.

798
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,395
We weren't supposed
to find each other.

799
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,440
But we did.

800
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:51,236
He makes me feel like my life
isn't over.

801
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,321
Like it's just beginning.

802
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,448
How was your day?

803
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,534
Good. I wrote a few pages.

804
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,744
Did you find anything
that can help us?

805
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,250
-I did.
-Are they real?

806
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,669
I cut them myself.

807
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,632
You know,
for two unlucky people,

808
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,092
we sure got pretty lucky.

809
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,013
[rumbling]

810
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,974
[Avalon] Attention.

811
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,561
You may wish to proceed
to a viewing area.

812
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,273
The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.

813
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,440
Look!

814
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,776
Oh, my God!

815
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,783
[Aurora gasps]

816
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,855
That was amazing.

817
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,400
A red giant.

818
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,032
The universe's present to you.

819
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,658
What?

820
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,995
Happy birthday.

821
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,955
[chuckles]

822
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:35,214
Happy birthday to you

823
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:39,385
Happy birthday to you

824
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:43,514
Happy birthday, dear Aurora

825
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:47,602
Happy birthday to you

826
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,939
[Arthur] A birthday drink
for the birthday girl.

827
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,191
Aren't you going to ask
for my ID?

828
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,442
I might not be old enough
to drink.

829
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,986
I would never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

830
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,905
Jim's no gentleman.

831
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,449
Anyway, there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

832
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,370
-Is that so?
-You heard the lady.

833
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,954
I will be right back.

834
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,971
This is a perfect
birthday drink.
Thank you.

835
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,725
I remember this day a year ago.

836
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,852
Jim was so looking forward
to meeting you.

837
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,146
What?

838
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,774
How could he be
looking forward to it?

839
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,652
He spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

840
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,822
He couldn't stop
talking about you.

841
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,744
Jim woke me up?

842
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,788
Yes.

843
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,333
He said it was
the hardest decision
of his life.

844
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,211
But I see it worked out
just fine.

845
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,766
What?

846
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,104
Did you wake me up?

847
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,196
Yes, I woke you up.

848
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,115
[gasps]

849
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,161
How...

850
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,121
How could you do it?

851
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,751
I tried not to.

852
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,335

01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,842
I'm gonna be sick.

I can't see.

[panting]

856
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,723
Aurora, please...

857
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,559
Stay away from me!

858
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,522
I can't get off this ship.

859
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,025
I can't get off this ship.
I can't get off.

861
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,330
No!

863
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,345
Oh, God.

864
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,561
Can I talk to you?

868
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,484
[Jim] Aurora,

869
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,987
I know nothing I can say
will make this okay.

870
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:51,989
But please listen.

871
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,283
I was so alone

872
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,619
for so long.

873
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,705
It felt like
I was disappearing.

874
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,210
The night I first saw you,
I was ready to...

875
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,798
You saved my life.

876
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,971
And I know that's no excuse
for what I did.

877
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,015
I read everything you wrote,

878
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:22,103
and I fell in love
with your voice

879
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,897
and with the way
your mind works.

880
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,441
I fell in love with you.

881
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,403
And all of a sudden,

882
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,906
it was like
I wasn't trapped anymore.

883
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,202
My pointless life suddenly
had meaning.

884
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,581
And I wish I could take
it back.

885
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,751
But I can't.

886
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,796
Aurora, I don't want
to lose you.

887
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,007
I don't care!

888
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,259
I don't care what you want!

889
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,178
I don't care why you
woke me up!

890
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,348
You took my life!

I envy you, Arthur.

899
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,123
How so?

900
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:08,042
You have a purpose.

901
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,879
You're always happy.

902
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,799
How's your book coming along?

903
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,426
I've never written
about myself before.

904
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,762
I think it's some of the best
work I've ever done,

905
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,806
and I don't even know
why I'm doing it.

906
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,935
There's only one person who
could read it,
and I can't stand him.

907
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:29,647
They say time heals all wounds.

908
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,027
Broken hearts
aren't that simple, Arthur.

909
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,490
You wouldn't understand.

910
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:42,409
[Jim] Arthur!

911
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,874
Tuesday's my day with Arthur.

912
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,334
It's Wednesday.

913
01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,760
The bar's all yours.

914
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,479
What'll you have? Whiskey?

915
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:12,982
Coffee.

916
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,984
Aurora! We love you!

917
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,194
What are we gonna
do without you?
We'll miss you so...

918
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,446
[crowd whooping]

919
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,490
You're the bravest woman
I know.

920
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:22,992
[crowd] Bye, Aurora!

921
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:27,079
I promise that I will think
of you every day.

922
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,248
When you wake up, I'll be gone,

923
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,126
but just know
that I will never forget you.

924
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,170
You're my best friend.

925
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,090
You were never happy here.
I know.

926
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,467
Nothing was ever
enough for you.

927
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,305
You know, you don't have to go.

928
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:47,266
You could do
whatever it is you have
to do right here.

929
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,519
But...

930
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,023
Since you're going,
here's my wish.

931
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:00,654
I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart,

932
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,948
and I hope you let him in.

933
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:08,704
I hope you realize you don't
have to do something amazing
to be happy.

934
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,792
You know, have fun,

935
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,212
take chances.

936
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,965
Um, okay.

937
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,885
I love you, Aurora.

938
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:24,678
Bye.

939
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:29,183
Morning, Arthur!

940
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,644
-Coffee, please.
-Coming up.

941
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,777
Are you soiling my barstool?

942
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,363
You want to make things,
you got to get
your hands dirty.

943
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,406
And what have you been making?

944
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:45,950
Improvements.

945
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,036
[Avalon] Grand concourse.

946
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,523
[Avalon] First floor.

947
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,566
-[loud thump]
-[elevator stops]

948
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,612
[distorted beep]

949
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,035
[beeps]

950
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,538
[Avalon]
Gold-class breakfast.

951
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,622
[gasps]

952
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,881
[grunts]

953
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:48,762
[groans]

954
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,307
[Gus over speaker]
This is Deck Chief
Gus Mancuso.

955
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:55,352
Who the hell planted a tree
on my ship?

956
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,667
-Who did that?
-I did.

957
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,419
Who are you?

958
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:21,795
Jim Preston.

959
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,590
Aurora Lane.

960
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,425
Anybody else awake?

961
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,760
Just me and him.

962
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,346
How far along are we?

963
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,222
Eighty-eight years to go.

964
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,936
[sighs]

965
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,483
Hibernation failure.

966
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:45,736
They said
that couldn't happen.

967
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:49,031
Three people,
three pod failures.

968
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,039
You have no idea
how long I've been
trying to get in there.

969
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:59,458
Now that you're in,
don't touch anything.

970
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,001
[Aurora]
This is where you work?

971
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,629
No, this is flight crew.
I'm a deck chief.

972
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,757
Ops, Navigation, Comm.

973
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:08,717
Hmm.

974
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,762
-[beep]
-[Avalon]
Unauthorized personnel.

975
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,014
Sorry.

976
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,182
[sighs]

977
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:19,395
If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

978
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,189
So whatever's wrong
with the ship,
NavCom is still on the job.

979
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:23,732
There's something wrong
with the ship?

980
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,360
Three pod failures?
Yeah, there's something wrong.

981
01:13:26,443 --> 01:13:28,070
Question is what.

982
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,032
That's strange.

983
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,952
We should be getting
diagnostics from all over
the ship right here,

984
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:36,870
but there's no data.

985
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,457
Got to check
all the systems manually.

986
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,668
Can't we turn
the ship around,
go back to Earth?

987
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,044
No, we're doing 50%
of light speed.

988
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:46,422
Turning back would
take just as much time
as going on.

989
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,257
Well, there's got to be
something we can do.

990
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,759
Sorry. We're going
where we're going.

991
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:52,845
[Gus exhales and grunts]

992
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:54,555
You okay?

993
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,182
Hibernation hangover.

994
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,642
Get it all the time.

995
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,145
[Avalon] Grand concourse.

996
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:02,479
Two years, huh?

997
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,523
Any more trees
I need to know about?

998
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,066
-[clack]
-Look out!

999
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,863
[clicking]

1000
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,406
Never seen that before.

1001
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,366
These robots
have been breaking down.

1002
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,077
This guy makes fifteen?

1003
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,745
Fifteen.

1004
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,289
The breakfast bar
went crazy today.

1005
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,708
-Yeah, and an elevator.
-Last week, my door broke.

1006
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,085
-I was trapped in my cabin
for two days.
-You were?

1007
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,881
Things like that
don't happen.
Not on this ship.

1008
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,092
There are 16 of these
tech stations on every deck.

1009
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,136
Dock your slate.

1010
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:36,138
-Data syncs automatically.
Got it?
-Hmm.

1011
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:37,931
-Yeah.
-[Gus] Okay.

1012
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:40,434
You take decks one and two.
You take decks three and four.

1013
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:44,313
I'm going down to
the hibernation bay,
check our pods.

1014
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:46,607
Well, that should
be interesting.

1015
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,203
Ain't you supposed to be
making your rounds?

1016
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,538
I'm finished.

1017
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:04,124
[clicks tongue]

1018
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,918
I checked your pod.

1019
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,505
Problem's very simple.
The clock chip's burnt out.

1020
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:12,341
It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

1021
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:13,926
My pod's more complicated.

1022
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,929
Bunch of system failures that
all happened at the same time.

1023
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:18,805
Whole damn thing went haywire.

1024
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,307
[inhales and grunts]

1025
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,018
Explains why
I'm feeling so bad.

1026
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,686
But Aurora's pod...

1027
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,400
You did this.

1028
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,029
[whispers] Yeah.

1029
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:36,448
All this time,
I'm thinking you're
one lucky son of a bitch

1030
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,116
to get stuck with Aurora.

1031
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:43,455
It wasn't luck, was it?

1032
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,249
[whispers] No.

1033
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,458
She knows?

1034
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,168
She knows.

1035
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:51,505
How long were you alone?

1036
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,382
A year.

1037
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:58,178
Still...

1038
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,390
Damn.

1039
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,189
[Avalon] Data received.

1040
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,525
[door whirring open]

1041
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,319
Data received.

1042
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,573
[Gus sighs]

1043
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,243
-Data received.
-Same as Jim's.

1044
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:22,536
Interpolating data.

1045
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:24,621
System shutdowns...

1046
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,999
Everywhere,
but no apparent connection.

1047
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,419
You saw the hibernation pods?

1048
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:32,754
I saw them.

1049
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:34,673
Data received.

1050
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:35,966
So you know...

1051
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,594
What Jim did.

1052
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,514
Yeah.

1053
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:44,850
And?

1054
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,436
-It's not my...
-He woke me up.

1055
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,313
He took away my life.

1056
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,565
I know, and I'm sorry,
but there's work I'd...

1057
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,066
It's murder.

1058
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,946
You're right, Aurora.

1059
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:01,408
But the drowning man
will always try and drag
somebody down with him.

1060
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,620
It ain't right,
but the man's drowning.

1061
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:06,330
[door whirring open]

1062
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,081
This one makes 16.

1063
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,419
[sighs] Yeah.

1064
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,088
[coughing]

1065
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:16,882
Hey. You okay?

1066
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,970
-You should go rest.
-[grunts] Yeah.

1067
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,306
But just a couple hours,

1068
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:27,100
and then back at it
first thing in the morning.

1069
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,603
[Gus sighs]

1070
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,571
[coughing]

1071
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:41,823
[retches]

1072
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,898
[rumbling]

1073
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:23,073
[beeping]

1074
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:45,762
[grunting]

1075
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:55,230

[muffled grunting]

1077

1086
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,061
I was in the pool
when the gravity gave out.

1087
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,187
Are you okay?

1088
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,480
We need to find Gus.

-[pounding]
-[Aurora] Gus! Gus!

1090
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:26,196
Gravity loss means that
whatever's wrong is starting
to hit the big-ticket items.

1091
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:27,531
Not good.

1092
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:30,158
Every failure's
a burnt out processor.

1093
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,577
Everything on board's
thinking too hard.

1094
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:34,579
Why?

1095
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,124

It started two years ago.
Power surge.

1099
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:49,761
Seventeen failures
in one day.

1100

Including

1101
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:53,807
That's me.

Woke me up.

1103
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:00,146
-What happened that day?
-Something big.

1104
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,357
A major system
went down somewhere.

1105
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,151
Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load,

1106
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:06,736
but the load's too heavy.

1107
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:08,738
Whatever started this,
we got to find it.

1108
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,449
-And fix it.
-How bad can this get?

1113
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,628

01:21:38,184 --> 01:21:41,062
Not a lot of things
big enough to hit
this ship that hard.

1118
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,818
With Diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it
ourselves.

Pansystemic necrosis.

Progressive organ failure.

That's the cause.

-What's the treatment?
-Various treatments
are possible.

1137

None will meaningfully extend
the patient's life.

What does that mean?

1265
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,074
The outer door is jammed.

1266
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:15,076
We've got to open that door
and cool the reactor down,

1267
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:16,577
or the whole ship
is gonna blow.

1268
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:19,163
-How?
-I got to go out there.

1269
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:21,040
Open it from the outside.

I open the door, I get clear.

01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:27,630
-You blow that fire
into space.
-You get clear?

1272
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:29,173
You can talk to me
through this.

1273
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:31,384
What happens to you
when that door opens?

1274
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,521
Heat shield. It might help.

1275
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:54,282
You might need this.

1276
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,005

-Thank you.
-Be still.

1436
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:26,890
Of course.

1437
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:13,896
There's something
I have to show you.

1438
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:15,731
In command mode,
it turns out

1439
01:43:15,814 --> 01:43:20,027
the Autodoc has an option
called Stabilize and Suspend.

1440
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:22,362
It stops
all metabolic activity.

1441
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:25,866
What are you saying?

1442
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:29,453
With Gus's ID,
it can be like hibernation
inside the Autodoc.

1443
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,579
You can go back to sleep.

1444
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,461
But there's only one Autodoc.

1445
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:42,883
Yeah.

1446
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:47,220
And you're gonna
lay down in it...

1447
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:49,473
And fall asleep.

1448
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:52,517
And you'll wake up
on Homestead II.

1449
01:43:52,976 --> 01:43:54,478
And you'll write your book.

1450
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:57,481
You'd finish your journey.

1451
01:43:57,564 --> 01:43:59,399
You'd do what you set out
to do.

1452
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:09,534
You'd be alone.

1453
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:12,746
I've been alone before.

1454
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:14,581
And I'll be fine.

1455
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:18,085
But I would
never see you again.

1456
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,048
I'll come and visit you.

1457
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:08,135
[Aurora] Tuesday is my day
with Arthur.

1458
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,680
[Arthur] Lovely as ever.

1459
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:14,141
Thank you, Arthur.
You're looking very well
yourself.

1460
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:15,475
Thanks to you.

1461
01:45:17,185 --> 01:45:18,103
What's that?

1462
01:45:20,647 --> 01:45:22,816
Something I've wanted
to give you
for a long time.

1463
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,408
It's beautiful.

1464
01:45:44,671 --> 01:45:46,715
Took you long enough to ask.

1465
01:45:49,968 --> 01:45:51,219
Champagne.

1466
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:52,929
I'll wait.

1467
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:12,032
[whispers]
Hell of a life.

1468
01:46:12,657 --> 01:46:14,201
[chuckles]

1469
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:16,036
[whispers]
Hell of a life.

1470
01:46:47,275 --> 01:46:50,862
[Avalon] Crew wake-up
process initiated.

1471
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,365
[Aurora]
My fellow passengers,

1472
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:54,866
if you're reading this,

1473
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:58,703
then the Starship Avalon
has reached its destination.

1474
01:46:58,787 --> 01:47:00,789
[Avalon]
Grand concourse.

1475
01:47:01,164 --> 01:47:02,999
[Aurora]
A lot happened
while you slept.

1476
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:12,342
A friend once said,

1477
01:47:12,634 --> 01:47:15,512
"You can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

1478
01:47:15,929 --> 01:47:19,057
that you forget to make
the most of where you are."

1479
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:21,935
We got lost along the way.

1480
01:47:22,936 --> 01:47:24,604
But we found each other.

1481
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:26,898
And we made a life.

1482
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:28,900
A beautiful life.

1483
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:30,902
Together.
